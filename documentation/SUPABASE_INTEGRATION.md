# Supabase Integration

## Overview
The server has been successfully integrated with Supabase database to replace the in-memory storage system.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Created `env.example` with all required environment variables
- Updated `config/index.ts` to include Supabase configuration
- Added validation for required Supabase environment variables

### 2. Supabase Service Layer
- Created `services/supabaseService.ts` with comprehensive database operations
- Implemented TypeScript interfaces for database types
- Added methods for all CRUD operations on players and rooms

### 3. Updated Room Service
- Replaced in-memory storage with Supabase database calls
- Updated all room operations to use the database
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Maintained compatibility with existing API endpoints

### 4. Updated Auth Controller
- Modified login process to create/retrieve users from database
- Integrated with Supabase player table
- Maintained JWT token generation

## Database Schema

### Player Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE player (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    room_id TEXT
);
```

### Room Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE room (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    room_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    game_id TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'waiting' CHECK (status IN ('waiting', 'playing', 'finished'))
);
```

## API Endpoints

All existing API endpoints remain the same, but now use Supabase:

- `POST /api/auth/login` - Creates/retrieves user from database
- `GET /api/auth/validate` - Validates JWT tokens
- `GET /api/rooms` - Fetches rooms from database
- `POST /api/rooms` - Creates room in database
- `GET /api/rooms/:roomId` - Gets room details from database
- `POST /api/rooms/:roomId/join` - Joins room (updates player record)
- `POST /api/rooms/:roomId/leave` - Leaves room (updates player record)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd src/server && npm install @supabase/supabase-js
   ```

2. **Create Environment File:**
   - Copy `env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your Supabase keys

3. **Set Up Database:**
   - Create the tables in your Supabase dashboard
   - Use the SQL provided above

4. **Test Connection:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Key Features

### Data Persistence
- All room and player data is now persisted in Supabase
- No more data loss on server restart
- Scalable across multiple server instances

### User Management
- Users are automatically created in database on first login
- User sessions are tracked across server restarts
- Player-room associations are maintained

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for database operations
- Graceful fallbacks for network issues
- Detailed logging for debugging

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript support with database types
- Compile-time checking for database operations
- IntelliSense support for all database methods

## Migration from In-Memory

The transition is seamless:
- All existing frontend code continues to work
- API responses remain the same
- No changes needed to frontend components
- Backward compatibility maintained

## Performance Considerations

- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
- Connection pooling handled by Supabase
- Caching can be added if needed
- Real-time subscriptions available for future features

## Security

- Environment variables for sensitive data
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Database-level constraints and validation
- CORS configuration maintained
- Rate limiting still in place
